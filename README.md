## Project Description

For this software mini project, we have implemented a COVID-19 Attestation web application. This application has the following components: 

* **SSO login**
* **Daily symptom tracker**: users can fill out a survey once daily detailing their COVID-19 symptoms
* **COVID statistics**: homepage with regional COVID data from https://covid19api.com/


We use Firebase to host our application. View it at https://covid-attestation.web.app/
